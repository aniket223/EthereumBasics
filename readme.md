This is an ethereum basics repository, where you will learn how to write go code
in ethereum. This requires basic knowledge of go and the functioning of
ethereum. I am also mentioning the order in which to read files so that it
becomes easy for anyone to dive into the ethereum codebase which can be a really
tough task as you donâ€™t know where to start and in which order the files should
be read, also there is a lot of code in ethereum so it is a tedious task, so you
can start from this repository and then dive into the ethereum codebase.

Order in which to read files

client.go

address.go

Account_balance.go

generate_wallet.go
