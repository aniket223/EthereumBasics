I have attached an installation.md file as well which you will be needing to
install various things before diving into this section. So that you have the
required environment.

After doing all the stuff in the installation.md file, start reading code in the
following manner:

1. contract_deploy.go
2. contract_load.go
3. contract_read.go
4. contract_write.go
5. contract_bytecode.go
6. erc20_contract_read.go
