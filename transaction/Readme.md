Order in which to read files:

1. blocks.go

2. transactions.go

3. Tranfer_eth.go

4. Transfer_tokens.go

You can create tokens needed in Transfer_tokens.go from tokenfactory.surge.sh, I
found one token contract already created by miguelmota and used that token
contract to run my code. 

You can check out the contract on
[https://tokenfactory.surge.sh/#/token/0x28b149020d2152179873ec60bed6bf7cd705775d](https://tokenfactory.surge.sh/#/token/0x28b149020d2152179873ec60bed6bf7cd705775d),
just make sure that you are using a web3 enabled browser and connected with
rinkeby test network on MetaMask, you can use your own private keys from
MetaMask and see the transaction in action(just add some test ether on rinkeby
testnet)
